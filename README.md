# Robotics Projects Showcase
The purpose of this repository is to highlight my proficiency and expertise in robotics by compiling some of my finest projects in the field. \
The following projects are the work of Dennis Rotondi, and in some cases, involve collaborative efforts. \
You can check the project repository for individual contributions.

### Description

This project is the result of the final work for the exam of [Autonomous Mobile and Robotics (AMR)](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/oriolo/amr/) WS 2022/23 with Professor [Giuseppe Oriolo](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/oriolo/) at Sapienza University of Rome. 
This project revolves around Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). A CBF is a mathematical function that represents a safety constraint. It is designed to ensure that the system stays within safe operating bounds or avoids unsafe states while achieving its control objectives (e.g. regulation). Our goal has been to implement the CBFs by exploiting the full knowledge of the Robot Dynamic Model and using only the kinematic one (also called the Model-Free approach due to the much simpler equations). The simulations (cf. additional resources) have been carried out using a point robot and a unicycle, highlighting the pros and cons of each approach.
